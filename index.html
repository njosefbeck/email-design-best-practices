                <h1>Email Design Best Practices</h1>

                <p>Designing and developing for e-mail can be <em>tough</em>. The e-mail client landscape is varied, diverse, and it can be a challenge to design in a way that looks good on all e-mail clients. As a developer, I often get design comps that don't take into account some common best practices when approaching email design. This leads to loss of time and to developer, designer, and client frustration as the e-mail needs to be reworked to fit the limitations of e-mail clients.</p>

                <p>By following the below practices <em>from the start</em> a lot of friction can be avoided when designing and developing HTML email. By no means is this list exhaustive! If you'd like to add to it, feel free to get in touch at njosefbeck@gmail.com.</p>

            <h2 class="dashed">When designing for e-mail:</h2>

            <ul class="best-practice-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Don't use custom fonts.</h3>

                    <p>Stick to web-safe fonts. For safe sans-serif fonts, stick to: <strong>Arial, Arial Black, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and Verdana</strong>. For serif fonts, stick to: <strong>Courier, Courier New, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman</strong>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>If the email needs to be responsive, using solid background colors or a background patterned image work best.</h3>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Don't send a developer an InDesign file with the design. Do a PDF instead. Or, even better, use <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> if you're on a Mac.</h3>

                    <p>There isn't much I can do with an InDesign file as far as extracting assets, getting correct typography sizes, etc. Print does not equal web!</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Send full-size versions of all image and icon assets (zipped up, outside of a PSD).</h3>
                </li>
            </ul>
